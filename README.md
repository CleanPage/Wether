# Wether
This is my pet project.
Written in Swift 5.6 and SwiftUI. 
Lottie's animation was also used in the project. 
The project gives the current weather (maximum and minimum temperature, humidity, wind speed and weather conditions) using your location. 
The user gives permission to use his geolocation and after that we get the standard API in Swift URLSession for this we use OpenWetherAPI
